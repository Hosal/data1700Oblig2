Kort beskrivelse av applikasjon (5-10 setninger):
This application is a very early prototype for a ticket ordering website.
It has currently not been styled, nor does it actually order any tickets.
It has two main features: Registering a ticket, and deleting tickets.
Every input field and dropdown menu has input validation, primarely done in JavaScript.
If a ticket sucessfully "registers" by filling all of the input fields and pressing the buy ticket button, it will be added to a table on the page.
This table, and all of the tickets can be removed by pressing the delete button.
The design of the website was made to stick as closely as possible to the one in the GUI example for the assignment text.
